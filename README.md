# MORGAN-Framework
Framework for performing regression with GANs from paper titled: Multi-Output Regression with Generative Adversarial Networks (MOR-GANs) (10.3390/app12189209). 

WGAN_model contains the class used to initalise and train a WGAN with gradient penalty. WGAN.predict() can then be used to make predictions in the output of the GAN
